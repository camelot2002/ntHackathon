Prerequisite libraries : pandas, streamlit, numpy, glob, os, altair. To dowload the libraries use pip install "library_name" . 

Steps to run the code: 

 Download the Repository and extract the files. 
 1. Preprocessing : The .csv files in the repository are all processed. But you can run the main.py to concatenate and the .csv files and handle the null values. 
                    If your sv files are not in the local path change the change it's path in preprocessing function in the utils.py . 
 
 2. Running the code : Run streamtest.py on the command line using "streamlit run streamtest.py" or  "python -m streamlit run streamtest.py" . 
                       Opens a locally hosted streamlit webapp with the output.
